# react-gdrive-image-viewer

This library lets you use your Google Drive as a mini data storage to view your Google Drive images on a custom page.

## Benefits
* **Easy to use**: Updating photos displayed on a webpage can be done easily by adding the images in a Google Drive directory.
* **No authentication required**: Use of the API does not require OAuth authentication. Simply your API key.
* **Secure**: Google API console ensures that all requests using your API key are narrowed to a specific host address.
* **Flexible**: Styling changes can be applied through a JSON passed as a prop to the object.

## Setup

### Create Google API Consle Key

* Naviage to https://console.developers.google.com/ and sign in with your google account.
* Select "Create". Type in your project name and hit "Create".
* On the page it takes you next, press on **"Enable APIs and Service"**. Select **"Google Drive API"** from the list and press **"Enable"**.
* On the next page, select **"Create Credentials"**, or from the left panel, select **"Credentials"** and **"Create API Key"**. 
* When asked, select **"Restrict Key"**. In the **"Application restrictions"**, select **"http referrers"**  and add your website as restriction item in **"Website restrictions"**.
* In **API restrictions** sections, select Restrict Key for **Google Drive API**. Click save when done.
* Copy and save your API Key to be used later.

### Setup Google Drive Directory

* Navigate to http://drive.google.com. Find the directory that you want to share. Make sure it only contains images in formats readable by Google Drive and your targeted browser.
* **NOTE: THIS DIRECTORY WILL BE ACCESSIBLE BY ANYONE WITH A LINK AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN THIS DIRECTORY.**
* Right click on the directory and select **"Get Sharable Link"**. Copy the link and extract the id from it.
* The id can be extracted as follows **https://drive.google.com/open?id=ID_GOES_HERE**
* Now that you have your directory ID and Google API Key, we are ready to use this react component.
